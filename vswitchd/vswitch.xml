<database title="Open Halon Configuration Database">
  <p>
    A database with this schema holds the configuration for one Open
    Halon system.
  </p>
  <p>
    The schema is derived from Open vSwitch schema.
    Tables/attributes which are not related to Open Halon first open source release
    (OSR1) were removed. Additionally the schema was extended to include OSR1
    features that don't exist in Open vSwitch, as well as information
    specific to a physical switch.
    Going forward, the expectation is to restore the Open vSwitch parts
    of the schema that were removed as we implement additional features.
  </p>
  <p>
    The top-level configuration is the
    <ref table="Open_vSwitch"/> table, which must have exactly one
    record. Records that are not reachable from
    the <ref table="Open_vSwitch"/> table are automatically deleted
    from the database, except for records in a few distinguished
    ``root set'' tables.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that a basic tenet of the Open Halon schema is that in the absence of any
    configuration, the default behavior of the Open Halon switch is such that
    no data traffic can be accepted or transmitted on any port or interface.
    Any future additions to the Open Halon schema must adhere to this principle.
  </p>

  <h2>Common Columns</h2>

  <p>
    Many tables contain two special columns, named <code>other_config</code>
    and <code>external_ids</code>. These columns have the same form and
    purpose each place that they appear, so we describe them here to save space
    later.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>other_config</code>: map of string-string pairs</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Key-value pairs for configuring rarely used features.  Supported keys,
        along with the forms taken by their values, are documented individually
        for each table.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few tables do not have <code>other_config</code> columns because no
        key-value pairs have yet been defined for them.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>external_ids</code>: map of string-string pairs</dt>
    <dd>
      Key-value pairs for use by external frameworks that integrate with Open
      Halon, rather than by Open Halon itself.  System integrators should
      either use the Open Halon development mailing list to coordinate on
      common key-value definitions, or choose key names that are likely to be
      unique.  In some cases, where key-value pairs have been defined that are
      likely to be widely useful, they are documented individually for each
      table.
